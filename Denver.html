            <h3>PREVIOUS RECORD: 53-29 (1<sup>st</sup> seed)</h3>

            <p>The defending champions! Last year's Nuggets squad was phenomenal to watch. The ball movement and team chemistry were through the roof. The high-powered
            offense, anchored by Jokic, who's undoubtedly the best playmaking big the NBA has ever seen, was unstoppable throughout the playoffs. No team could find
            an answer to the Murray-Jokic pick & roll, if you throw a double team at them, then it's an easy dish out for an open three by Porter Jr. or KCP. And going
            one-on-one with Murray was a disaster for any team, he torched his opponents with some dazzling shots from almost anywhere in the half-court set. Jokic
            continued his dominance as well, his excellent footwork and extended range makes it impossible for any big man to guard him one-on-one. Now the Nuggets
            retained almost everyone from their championship run, except Brown and Green. Brown is the bigger hit, as he got a lot of minutes and was a key part of
            the Nugget's dominant run. He had moments where he took over on offense by slashing to the rim or knocking down his three-point shots. He's also a great
            defender, averaging 1.1 steals per game last year and playing with physical toughness. Green was a veteran who gave the Nuggets an athletic wing defender
            who could penetrate his way toward the rim for an easy dunk or layup. Denver will be adding Justin Holiday to their group, who struggled offensively last
            year. However, Holiday is known more for his defensive capabilities, and the Nuggets already have enough offensive fire-power to cover for Holiday's shooting
            struggles. Will the Nuggets continue their story of success and look to repeat as NBA champions?
