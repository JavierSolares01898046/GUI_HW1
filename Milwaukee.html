        <h3>PREVIOUS RECORD: 58-24 (1<sup>st</sup> seed)</h3>

        <p>The Milwaukee Bucks had a very strong season last year, finishing first among teams in the Eastern Conference. Led by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue
        Holiday, the Bucks were a threat on both the offensive and defensive sides. Losing out on Matthews and Ingles could hurt their spacing as both of these 
        players served as a catch-and-shoot role whenever Giannis drives into the paint and dishes it out. However, Matthews had one of his least efficient
        seasons in terms of offensive production and shooting percentages. Yet, both Matthews and Ingles were great wing defenders off the bench and the Bucks 
        will surely notice this impact. Also, the loss of Carter will be quite noticeable as the Bucks don't have a primary ball handler off the bench anymore 
        unless they want to rely on the soon-to-be-37-year-old Dragic to orchestrate the offense when Holiday and Middleton sit out. Now let's look at the main
        additions, except there really is only one. The Bucks basically retained their core group of players and added Beasley in free agency, who came over
        from the Los Angeles Lakers. Beasley will look to fill the void that Matthews left by being the primary three-point specialist on drives and kicks by
        Holiday and Giannis. If he can find his rhythm with this group, then opponents will have a hard time stopping the barrage of threes from him and Allen.
        Some might say that the Bucks will have a worse season than last year because they're losing more than gaining. However, Middleton did miss the majority
        of the season last year, so with a fully healthy Bucks squad I'd expect them to be at around the same record. And with the injury of Giannis in the playoffs,
        which kept him out for two pivotal games against the Miami Heat, there's no doubt that he's looking to take back his throne now that he's rested and ready
        to go for the season.
