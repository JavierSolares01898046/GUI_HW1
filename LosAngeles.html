            <h3>PREVIOUS RECORD: 43-39 (7<sup>th</sup> seed)</h3>

            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers didn't have one of the strongest seasons last year, yet they found a way to make a deep playoff run and get to the conference
            finals. This is what happens when you have a guy named LeBron James on your team, you're destined to have playoff success. Also, having a great GM in Rob
            Pelinka will help keep the stars motivated and compete at their highest level. He had a big impact on the turnaround of the Laker's season last year and continues
            his magic going into this season with the offseason additions of Hayes, Reddish, Vincent, and Wood. Adding Hayes into the frontcourt will allow Anthony Davis
            to play at his natural position, the power forward, and will make it a nightmare for anyone trying to attack the paint. Hayes provides great rim protection
            while being an athletic lob threat on the offensive end if Davis or LeBron were to get doubled. Reddish and Prince will most likely come off the bench to serve 
            as spot-up shooters who can occasionally attack the basket. These guys will replace Walker's role, who had a solid performance towards the end of last year. 
            After a strong playoff run, Vincent will certainly serve as a great reserve, he provides great three-point shooting and can create his own space to get off his 
            shot, which is what Beasley provided the Lakers off the bench, but he struggled in the playoffs to knock down perimeter shots. The biggest addition has to be 
            Wood, who the Lakers signed for at the bare minimum. He's a strong sixth-man candidate that'll space out the floor and keep the offense pushing when he attacks 
            the paint (Lakers didn't have a stretch big other than AD). The only loss that'll somewhat hurt the Lakers is Schroder, who recently earned the 2023 FIBA World 
            Cup MVP. He proved to be a threat whenever he drove downhill with his quick burst of speed to the paint, as well as his persistent on-ball defense that annoyed
            opponents.
