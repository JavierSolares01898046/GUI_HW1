            <h3>PREVIOUS RECORD: 57-25 (2<sup>nd</sup> seed)</h3>

            <p>The Boston Celtics had a very strong season last year and were the favorites to make it out the eastern conference. However, the heroic run by Butler
            and the rest of the Heat stopped them short in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, I know what Celtics fans are feeling right now, excited yet heartbroken. 
            The trade for Kristaps Porzingis this offseason was a big deal, as Boston shipped away their beloved hometown hero in Marcus Smart. To Celtics fans, Smart
            represented the heart and soul of the team. He was willing to put his body on the line in order to win a game for his team, hustling for loose balls or
            exerting an extraordinary amount of energy on the defensive end in order to come up with a key stop. His leadership was huge and present among everyone, 
            anchoring the strong defense that Boston had. The 2022 Defensive Player of the Year will now be playing for the Memphis Grizzlies and serve as a mentor 
            for the young stars over there. Another loss for the Celtics is Grant, who gave them great minutes knocking down threes and sometimes guarding the opposing 
            team's best player. Even though Boston lost Smart and Grant, they gained a 7'3'', 240 pound stretch big in Porzingis. He's coming off one of his best
            seasons were he produced a career high in ppg (23.2), steals (0.9), and field goal percentage (49.8%) as a member of the Washington Wizards. He will
            provide excellent floor spacing, shooting at 38.5% from three-point territory, and add onto the terrific front court defense that the Celtics already have
            with his long wingspan and ability to block shots. A front court of Robert Willams and KP will be a shot blocking party for any opponent trying to drive
            into the paint, not to mention that they have to get past Tatum and Brown on the wing, who are probably the leagues top defenders. Mykhailiuk will bring
            in his terrific three-point shooting (40.4% from deep last year) and take on a catch and shoot role. With Smart now gone, Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon
            will get extended minutes in the back court, two very talented guards who can score at will, as well as contain their opponent defensively. With all this
            talent that Boston posesses, it's hard to not see them making it out of the eastern conference and compete for the Larry O'Brien trophy.
