Description: This is the main webpage, from here it gives a short, but interesting 
reading about the upcoming NBA season. Below the reading is a list of the top
5 teams that I predicted. Each one is a link that takes you to a page where I
talk about the new look teams.

			<p>Hello NBA fanatics! It's that time of year again when everyone predicts which team will rise among the rest. 
			Which team is going to claim the Larry O'Brien trophy at the end and cement their legacy? Will this be LeBron's final run? 
			Can Tatum finally get over the hump and raise Banner 18 into the rafters? How good will the offensive firepower of the 
			KD-Booker-Beal trio be against the rest of the league? Is this a revenge season for the Bucks after the quick, disappointing 
			end in last year's playoffs. Or will Jokic, Murray, and the rest of the squad dominate and repeat as champions. Lets take a look
			and dive into the top 5 teams that I believe will be competing for the bragging rights this year.</p>
			
			<!-- I use a span here so I could add an overline in my .css file because I already have an underline under <h1> -->
			<h1><span>RANKINGS</span></h1>

			<!-- Added a <div class> to center the list in a neat way -->
			<div class="container">
				<!-- These are the rankings of the top 5 teams; I'll create seperate links for each discussing why I believe they're in the correct order -->
