            <h3>PREVIOUS RECORD: 45-37 (4<sup>th</sup> seed)</h3>

            <p>The Phoenix Suns are looking even more scary than last year, and they were already great. If you are a Suns fan you have to rejoice at the team that
            James Jones, the General Manager of the Suns, has built this offseason. Swapping out Paul and Shamet for Beal is a huge win in favor of the Suns as the
            guard from Washington looks to join a stacked roster already consisting of Kevin Durant and Devin Booker. Also, the Suns took away two games against the
            Denver Nuggets without Paul, as well as Shamet having shooting struggles. Inserting Beal, who's a terrific three-level scorer, into the lineup will make 
            it extremely challenging for opponents to limit their scoring. It'll also open up drives for Booker and KD as they tend to get doubled, which will lead
            to an open Beal. I believe Eubanks will replace Landale's minutes, both of these players have similar styles being good shot blockers and a big body in
            the paint. Losing Craig's defensive presence isn't a big deal either since the Suns will be replacing him with a taller and stronger 3-and-D player in
            Bates-Diop, who had a solid season with the Spurs last year shooting close to 40% from three and averaging 9.7 ppg. Payne is another loss for this Suns 
            team, he provided a spark off the bench and could even carry the offense himself with his quick drives. However, the Suns already have so many talented
            offensive players, such as the addition of the three-point specialist, Eric Gordon. Plus, two more stretch bigs in Bol and Watanabe will space out the
            floor and make this offense one of the best three-point shooting teams in the league. The only downside I can really see for this team is the presence of
            a big man who can guard the low post. Who's going to match up against Jokic if there were to be a rematch in the conference finals? We clearly saw that
            Ayton wasn't up to the task. Perhaps Eubanks? Or maybe Jones will put together a trade package to find a solution against the Joker. Even as is, this
            team clearly has what it takes to win the title.
